# Configuration file for Synapse.
#
# This is a YAML file: see [1] for a quick introduction. Note in particular
# that *indentation is important*: all the elements of a list or dictionary
# should have the same indentation.
#
# [1] https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html
#
# For more information on how to configure Synapse, including a complete accounting of
# each option, go to docs/usage/configuration/config_documentation.md or
# https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html

## Server ##

# The public-facing domain of the server
#
# The server_name name will appear at the end of usernames and room addresses
# created on this server. For example if the server_name was example.com,
# usernames on this server would be in the format @user:example.com
#
# In most cases you should avoid using a matrix specific subdomain such as
# matrix.example.com or synapse.example.com as the server_name for the same
# reasons you wouldn't use user@email.example.com as your email address.
# See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html
# for information on how to host Synapse on a subdomain while preserving
# a clean server_name.
#
# The server_name cannot be changed later so it is important to
# configure this correctly before you start Synapse. It should be all
# lowercase and may contain an explicit port.
# Examples: matrix.org, localhost:8080
#
server_name: "{{ server_name }}"

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
#
pid_file: /run/matrix-{{ app }}/homeserver.pid

# The absolute URL to the web client which / will redirect to.
#
web_client_location: {{ web_client_location }}

# The public-facing base URL that clients use to access this Homeserver (not
# including _matrix/...). This is the same URL a user might enter into the
# 'Custom Homeserver URL' field on their client. If you use Synapse with a
# reverse proxy, this should be the URL to reach Synapse via the proxy.
# Otherwise, it should be the URL to reach Synapse's client HTTP listener (see
# 'listeners' below).
#
# Defaults to 'https://<server_name>/'.
#
public_baseurl: https://{{ domain }}/

# If set to 'true', removes the need for authentication to access the server's
# public rooms directory through the client API, meaning that anyone can
# query the room directory. Defaults to 'false'.
#
allow_public_rooms_without_auth: {{ allow_public_rooms_without_auth }}

# If set to 'true', allows any other homeserver to fetch the server's public
# rooms directory via federation. Defaults to 'false'.
#
allow_public_rooms_over_federation: {{ allow_public_rooms_over_federation }}

# Prevent outgoing requests from being sent to the following blacklisted IP address
# CIDR ranges. If this option is not specified then it defaults to private IP
# address ranges (see the example below).
#
# The blacklist applies to the outbound requests for federation, identity servers,
# push servers, and for checking key validity for third-party invite events.
#
# (0.0.0.0 and :: are always blacklisted, whether or not they are explicitly
# listed here, since they correspond to unroutable addresses.)
#
# This option replaces federation_ip_range_blacklist in Synapse v1.25.0.
#
# Note: The value is ignored when an HTTP proxy is in use

# List of ports that Synapse should listen on, their purpose and their
# configuration.
#
# Options for each listener include:
#
#   port: the TCP port to bind to
#
#   bind_addresses: a list of local addresses to listen on. The default is
#       'all local interfaces'.
#
#   type: the type of listener. Normally 'http', but other valid options are:
#       'manhole' (see https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/manhole.html),
#       'metrics' (see https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/metrics-howto.html),
#       'replication' (see https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html).
#
#   tls: set to true to enable TLS for this listener. Will use the TLS
#       key/cert specified in tls_private_key_path / tls_certificate_path.
#
#   x_forwarded: Only valid for an 'http' listener. Set to true to use the
#       X-Forwarded-For header as the client IP. Useful when Synapse is
#       behind a reverse-proxy.
#
#   resources: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A list of resources to host
#       on this port. Options for each resource are:
#
#       names: a list of names of HTTP resources. See below for a list of
#           valid resource names.
#
#       compress: set to true to enable HTTP compression for this resource.
#
#   additional_resources: Only valid for an 'http' listener. A map of
#        additional endpoints which should be loaded via dynamic modules.
#
# Valid resource names are:
#
#   client: the client-server API (/_matrix/client), and the synapse admin
#       API (/_synapse/admin). Also implies 'media' and 'static'.
#
#   consent: user consent forms (/_matrix/consent).
#       See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/consent_tracking.html.
#
#   federation: the server-server API (/_matrix/federation). Also implies

#
#   keys: the key discovery API (/_matrix/keys).
#
#   media: the media API (/_matrix/media).
#
#   metrics: the metrics interface.
#       See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/metrics-howto.html.
#
#   openid: OpenID authentication.
#
#   replication: the HTTP replication API (/_synapse/replication).
#       See https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html.
#
#   static: static resources under synapse/static (/_matrix/static). (Mostly
#       useful for 'fallback authentication'.)
#

#
admin_contact: 'mailto:root'


## TLS ##

# PEM-encoded X509 certificate for TLS.
# This certificate, as of Synapse 1.0, will need to be a valid and verifiable
# certificate, signed by a recognised Certificate Authority.
#
# Be sure to use a `.pem` file that includes the full certificate chain including
# any intermediate certificates (for instance, if using certbot, use
# `fullchain.pem` as your certificate, not `cert.pem`).
#
tls_certificate_path: "/etc/yunohost/certs/{{ domain }}/crt.pem"

# PEM-encoded private key for TLS
#
tls_private_key_path: "/etc/yunohost/certs/{{ domain }}/key.pem"


## Database ##

# The 'database' setting defines the database that synapse uses to store all of
# its data.
#
# 'name' gives the database engine to use: either 'sqlite3' (for SQLite) or
# 'psycopg2' (for PostgreSQL).
#
# 'txn_limit' gives the maximum number of transactions to run per connection
# before reconnecting. Defaults to 0, which means no limit.
#
# 'allow_unsafe_locale' is an option specific to Postgres. Under the default behavior, Synapse will refuse to
# start if the postgres db is set to a non-C locale. You can override this behavior (which is *not* recommended)
# by setting 'allow_unsafe_locale' to true. Note that doing so may corrupt your database. You can find more information
# here: https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/postgres.html#fixing-incorrect-collate-or-ctype and here:
# https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Locale_data_changes
#
# 'args' gives options which are passed through to the database engine,
# except for options starting 'cp_', which are used to configure the Twisted
# connection pool. For a reference to valid arguments, see:
#   * for sqlite: https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.connect
#   * for postgres: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS
#   * for the connection pool: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool.html#__init__

## API Configuration ##

# a secret which is used to sign access tokens. If none is specified,
# the registration_shared_secret is used, if one is given; otherwise,
# a secret key is derived from the signing key.
#

# Well, in this package this value was not managed because it was not needed, synapse is able to generate this with some other secret in the config file but after some vulnerability was found with this practice.
# For more detail about this issue you can see : https://matrix.org/blog/2019/01/15/further-details-on-critical-security-update-in-synapse-affecting-all-versions-prior-to-0-34-1-cve-2019-5885/
# The problem is that we can't just say generate a new value if the package has not already defined a value. The reason is that changing this value logout all user. And in case of a user has enabled the encryption, the user might lost all conversation !!
# So for the old install we just leave this as it is. And for the new install we use a real macaroon.
{%- if macaroon_secret_key is defined %}
macaroon_secret_key: '{{ macaroon_secret_key }}'
{%- endif %}

# a secret which is used to calculate HMACs for form values, to stop
# falsification of values. Must be specified for the User Consent
# forms to work.
#
form_secret: "{{ form_secret }}"

## Signing Keys ##

# Path to the signing key to sign messages with
#
signing_key_path: "/etc/matrix-{{ app }}/homeserver.signing.key"

# The keys that the server used to sign messages with but won't use
# to sign new messages.
#
old_signing_keys:
  # For each key, `key` should be the base64-encoded public key, and
  # `expired_ts`should be the time (in milliseconds since the unix epoch) that
  # it was last used.
  #
  # It is possible to build an entry from an old signing.key file using the
  # `export_signing_key` script which is provided with synapse.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #"ed25519:id": { key: "base64string", expired_ts: 123456789123 }

# The trusted servers to download signing keys from.
#
# When we need to fetch a signing key, each server is tried in parallel.
#
# Normally, the connection to the key server is validated via TLS certificates.
# Additional security can be provided by configuring a `verify key`, which
# will make synapse check that the response is signed by that key.
#
# This setting supercedes an older setting named `perspectives`. The old format
# is still supported for backwards-compatibility, but it is deprecated.
#
# 'trusted_key_servers' defaults to matrix.org, but using it will generate a
# warning on start-up. To suppress this warning, set
# 'suppress_key_server_warning' to true.
#
# Options for each entry in the list include:
#
#    server_name: the name of the server. required.
#
#    verify_keys: an optional map from key id to base64-encoded public key.
#       If specified, we will check that the response is signed by at least
#       one of the given keys.
#
#    accept_keys_insecurely: a boolean. Normally, if `verify_keys` is unset,
#       and federation_verify_certificates is not `true`, synapse will refuse
#       to start, because this would allow anyone who can spoof DNS responses
#       to masquerade as the trusted key server. If you know what you are doing
#       and are sure that your network environment provides a secure connection
#       to the key server, you can set this to `true` to override this
#       behaviour.
#
# An example configuration might look like:
#
#trusted_key_servers:
#  - server_name: "my_trusted_server.example.com"
#    verify_keys:
#      "ed25519:auto": "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmopqr"
#  - server_name: "my_other_trusted_server.example.com"
#
trusted_key_servers:
  - server_name: "matrix.org"


## Single sign-on integration ##

# The following settings can be used to make Synapse use a single sign-on
# provider for authentication, instead of its internal password database.
#
# You will probably also want to set the following options to `false` to
# disable the regular login/registration flows:
#   * enable_registration
#   * password_config.enabled
#
# You will also want to investigate the settings under the "sso" configuration
# section below.

# Enable Central Authentication Service (CAS) for registration and login.
#
cas_config:
  # Uncomment the following to enable authorization against a CAS server.
  # Defaults to false.
  #
  enabled: true

  # The URL of the CAS authorization endpoint.
  #
  server_url: "https://{{ domain }}/_matrix/cas_server.php"

  # The attribute of the CAS response to use as the display name.
  #
  # If unset, no displayname will be set.
  #
  #displayname_attribute: name

  # It is possible to configure Synapse to only allow logins if CAS attributes
  # match particular values. All of the keys in the mapping below must exist
  # and the values must match the given value. Alternately if the given value
  # is None then any value is allowed (the attribute just must exist).
  # All of the listed attributes must match for the login to be permitted.
  #
  #required_attributes:
  #  userGroup: "staff"
  #  department: None


# Additional settings to use with single-sign on systems such as OpenID Connect,
# SAML2 and CAS.

#
sso:
    # A list of client URLs which are whitelisted so that the user does not
    # have to confirm giving access to their account to the URL. Any client
    # whose URL starts with an entry in the following list will not be subject
    # to an additional confirmation step after the SSO login is completed.
    #
    # WARNING: An entry such as "https://my.client" is insecure, because it
    # will also match "https://my.client.evil.site", exposing your users to
    # phishing attacks from evil.site. To avoid this, include a slash after the
    # hostname: "https://my.client/".
    #
    # The login fallback page (used by clients that don't natively support the
    # required login flows) is whitelisted in addition to any URLs in this list.
    #
    # By default, this list contains only the login fallback page.

## Push ##

push:
  # Clients requesting push notifications can either have the body of
  # the message sent in the notification poke along with other details
  # like the sender, or just the event ID and room ID (`event_id_only`).
  # If clients choose the former, this option controls whether the
  # notification request includes the content of the event (other details
  # like the sender are still included). For `event_id_only` push, it
  # has no effect.
  #
  # For modern android devices the notification content will still appear
  # because it is loaded by the app. iPhone, however will send a
  # notification saying only that a message arrived and who it came from.
  #
  # The default value is "true" to include message details. Uncomment to only
  # include the event ID and room ID in push notification payloads.
  #
  include_content: {{ push_include_content }}

  # When a push notification is received, an unread count is also sent.
  # This number can either be calculated as the number of unread messages
  # for the user, or the number of *rooms* the user has unread messages in.
  #
  # The default value is "true", meaning push clients will see the number of
  # rooms with unread messages in them. Uncomment to instead send the number
  # of unread messages.
  #
  #group_unread_count_by_room: false


## Rooms ##

# Controls whether locally-created rooms should be end-to-end encrypted by
# default.
#
# Possible options are "all", "invite", and "off". They are defined as:
#
# * "all": any locally-created room
# * "invite": any room created with the "private_chat" or "trusted_private_chat"
#             room creation presets
# * "off": this option will take no effect
#
# The default value is "off".
#
# Note that this option will only affect rooms created after it is set. It
# will also not affect rooms created by other servers.
