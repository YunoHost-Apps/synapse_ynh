This new update provide some internal changes. Mainly:

- All code are moved in `/var/www` instead of `/opt/yunohost`. This imply that the `Coturn_config_rotate.sh` script is moved into `/var/www`. Some matrix briges might be broken because of this and will need to be updated.
- The support for element call was added. To use this new feature some port need to be open in addition to the previous ports dedicated to turnserver.
- A settings was added into the config panel to provide an admin contact in case of abuse or technical issue. So it's highly recommended set a admin contact (email or/and matrix ID) from the config panel in 'Main settings' > 'Contact for the administrator of the synapse instance'
